Quil sketches.

## core

Circles with randomly-generated attributes moving in circular orbits around randomly-generated origins. Circles slowly change hue as time advances. Each circle has a lifetime and its brightness is directly proportional to the time it has left. New circles are created with a low probability or on a mouse click.

## Usage

REPL: e.g. run `(require 'my-sketch.core)`
